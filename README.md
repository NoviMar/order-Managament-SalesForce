How to create Custom Object and Fields



## User stories:
As a user, I can open an Order Management page from Account layout (You need to put a button to Account layout that will open an Order Management page in separate tab)

As a user, I can see Account Name and Number on the page
Data Binding in a Template

As a user, I can filter the displayed product by Family and Type

As a user, I can search for the product by Name and Description

As a user, I can see product details in modal window (Details button on Product Tile)
Modal Window

As a user, I can select a product and add it to Cart (Add button on Product Tile)
Show Toast message

As a user, I can see products in the Cart (Cart button will open a modal with selected products in table view)

As a user, I can check out a Cart (Checkout button on Cart Modal) This action will create Order and Order Item records. 

TotalProductCount__c and TotalPrice__c on Order__c object should be calculated automatically in a Trigger based on Order Items records.

As a user, after checking out the cart I should be redirected to the standard Order layout to see created Order and Order Items

As a manager, I should have the ability to create a new product in the modal window. (Create a Product button. The button should be available only for users with IsManager__c = true)

If the Image field on the Product object is empty. You need to send a request to http://www.glyffix.com/api/Image?word={PRODUCT_NAME}, where {PRODUCT_NAME} is the name of the created product and put the link to the Image field. More information about the API you can find here. Example of the request below:
